# Write a program to find the roots of a quadratic equation when the coefficients a, b and c are given ( assume that a, b and c are integers)
# Hint: find the discriminant d= b2 âˆ’ 4ac
# If d = 0, the equation has one real repeated root (both roots are the same: 
# R1= R2 = -b/(2a)

# If d > 0, the equation has two distinct real roots.

# If d < 0, the equation has two complex roots.
